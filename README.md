Probabilistic Rand Index
========================


 ### Description

Computes the Probabilistic Rand Index (PRI) to measure the similarity between two clusterings (partitions) of a set of objects.





 ### Value

A single value between 0 and 1.



 ### Details
 The Probabilistic Rand Index is a refinement of the Rand Index, in which agreements and disagreements at the object-pair level are weighted according to the probability of their occurring by chance.




 ### Usage and Languages
The instructions are provided in the subdirectories. The Probabilistic Rand Index has been implemented 
in four languages: Ansi C, Python, R, Common Lisp.
